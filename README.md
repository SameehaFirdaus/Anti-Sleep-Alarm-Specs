# Anti-Sleep Alarm Specs

## Overview
The **Anti-Sleep Alarm Specs** is a safety device designed to keep drivers and individuals awake and alert. It detects signs of drowsiness and provides an alarm to prevent accidents caused by microsleep episodes.

## Features
- **Drowsiness Detection**: Uses sensors (e.g., IR sensors, accelerometers, or camera-based eye-tracking) to detect signs of sleepiness.
- **Audio & Vibration Alerts**: Generates an alarm sound or vibration to wake the user.
- **Wearable or Dashboard Mounted**: Can be designed as an ear mounted device or integrated into a vehicle dashboard.

- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Adjustable alert levels based on user preference.
- **Power Efficient**: Designed for long battery life with low-power components.

## Hardware Specifications
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino, ESP8266, or Raspberry Pi (depending on complexity)
- **Sensors**:
